Class Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So that I can keep track of my music listening
I want to add tracks I've listened to and see a list of them.

## 2. Design the Class Interface

class PlayList
    def Initialize(person)
        personalised playlisy
    end

    def add_track(track)
        adds tracks
    end
    def list_tracks
        returns list of tracks
    end

end


## 3. Create Examples as Tests

Spec1 - throws exception if no tracks are aded in list

        playlist = Playlist.new("Rex")
        expect{playlist.list_tracks}.to raise_error "Playlist empty"

Spec 2- Lists the tracks listened to single track


        playlist = Playlist.new("Rex")
        playlist.add_track("Track1")
        expect(playlist.list_tracks).to eq "Rex you have listened to : Track 1Spec 2- Lists the tracks listened to 


Spec 3- Tracks listened multiple times are listed only once
        playlist = Playlist.new("Rex")
        playlist.add_track("Track1")
        playlist.add_track("Track2")
        playlist.add_track("Track1")
        expect(playlist.list_tracks).to eq "Rex you have listened to : Track 1, Track2"


Spec 4- Adds multiple tracks
        playlist = Playlist.new("Rex")
        playlist.add_track("Track1")
        playlist.add_track("Track2")
        playlist.add_track("Track3")
        expect(playlist.list_tracks).to eq "Rex you have listened to : Track 1, Track2, Track3"





## 4. Implement the Behaviour
